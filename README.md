# AK_AOA_inventory
 
Please note that the example CSV file I created was a copy of the corresponding tab within the original [AK AOA inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t50qANMF4Kn8i-XG_P2hwgxDGBlg-Dfa/edit#gid=717914943) and then I edited the column names and exported it as a csv. Please use my naming conventions for the columns so we keep things consistent if you are doing this (mainly we need to make sure there are `_` in the titles.)

For now, `UNIQUE_ID` will be used for the codes; axiom codes are good, any data that is listed and not in our inventory, put `NA`; any data that is listed and is in our inventory, we will start using convention `NAKG000.gpkg`. 
If/when you begin creating these codes, please consult with the group so we ensure there are not duplicate codes!
